**SeniorLove** is a contact management desktop app which aims to facilitate community workers' visits to the elderly. It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Senior Love can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Notes about command format:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [h/HEALTH_CONDITION]` can be used as `n/John Doe h/dementia` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[h/HEALTH_CONDITION]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `h/dementia`, `h/dementia h/diabetes` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Locating elderly by attribute : `find`

Finds elderly whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will not match `Bo Hans`
* All attributes are searched (`NAME`, `PHONE`, `LANGUAGE`, `ADDRESS`, `VISIT`, `LAST_VISIT`)

* Persons matching all given keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
  e.g. `Hans English` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Hanson Lim`, both of which have `LANGUAGE` English

* `FREQUENCY` has to take on one of the following values: `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Biweekly`, `Monthly` and `Quarterly`.
* `OCCURRENCE` is a **strictly positive integer**.

### Marking one visit as done : `done`

Marks a scheduled visit to an elderly as done.

Format: `done INDEX`

* `INDEX` is the index of the elderly visited by the user. It is a **strictly positive integer, and must be included.** There must be a scheduled visit for the elderly before the visit can be marked as done.
* Once a scheduled visit is marked as done, it will update the last visited time of the elderly, and now there is no longer a scheduled next visit for the elderly.
